# The amount of peers that should be sent back if the peer does not
# include a numwant.
#
# Default: 15
NUMWANT_DEFAULT=15
# The max amount of peers that should be sent back if the peer's numwant
# is too high.
#
# Default: 15
NUMWANT_MAX=15
# A random amount of seconds between announce_min and announce_max will
# be returned to the peer for the next time they should announce.
#
# Default: 1800
ANNOUNCE_MIN=1800
# If a user announces before this many seconds after their previous
# announce, then they will receive a rate limit error.
#
# Default: 1740
ANNOUNCE_MIN_ENFORCED=1740
# A random amount of seconds between announce_min and announce_max will
# be returned to the peer for the next time they should announce.
#
# Default: 3600
ANNOUNCE_MAX=3600
# Max amount of active peers a user is allowed to have on a torrent.
# Prevents abuse from malicious users causing the server to run out of ram,
# as well as keeps the peer lists from being filled with too many clients
# of a single user.
#
# Default: 3
MAX_PEERS_PER_TORRENT_PER_USER=3
# The interval (in milliseconds) between when history, peers, torrents and
# users are flushed to the postgresql database.

# Amount of seconds between scheduled batches where peers are marked as
# inactive or erased from memory.
#
# Default: 1800
PEER_EXPIRY_INTERVAL=1800
# Amount of seconds since the last announce before a peer is considered
# inactive.
#
# Default: 7200
ACTIVE_PEER_TTL=7200
# Amount of seconds since the last announce before a peer is erased from
# memory. This value should be long enough that users can suffer
# multi-day network outages without announcing, otherwise if their setup
# comes back online and the peer has been erased, then their new stats
# will be recorded incorrectly.
#
# Default: 1814400
INACTIVE_PEER_TTL=1814400
# The header provided by the reverse proxy that includes the bittorrent

# on unix sockets.

# Default: <commented out>
# Example: "X-Real-IP"
# REVERSE_PROXY_CLIENT_IP_HEADER_NAME="X-Real-IP"
