///      seeder = false (catches users who disconnected between leech attempts so their in-memory
///      db peer is gone), and no completed_at on their torrent_activities row
///    - or, when charge_on_resnatch is disabled, a previously completed snatch: the snatch
///      cost is then paid at most once per torrent and per user
///
///    A grab-only torrent_activities row (the .torrent file was downloaded but the user
///    never announced) never counts as already paid.
/// 3. Deducts points if: cost > 0, user is not uploader, has not paid already, has enough points
/// 4. Optionally transfers the deducted points to uploader or current seeders
