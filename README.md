Arcadia is a torrent site and tracker, aiming at providing an **easy to setup** and **configurable**, **highly organized** and **content agnostic** platform.

The backend is built with Rust for speed and safety. The frontend is built with Typescript and VueJS, rendered client-side.

For setting up arcadia and/or contributing, have a look at [the docs](https://arcadia-solutions.github.io/arcadia/)!

### Collections

Collections represent a "grouping" of content, to avoid having multiple uploads to do and to limit the load on the tracker. This can be useful for site-dumps, full/finished series, monthly/yearly grouping of content etc.
