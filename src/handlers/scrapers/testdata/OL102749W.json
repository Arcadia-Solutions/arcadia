{"description": "\"Command the murderous chalices! Drink ye harpooners! Drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful whaleboat's bow -- Death to Moby Dick!\" So Captain Ahab binds his crew to fulfil his obsession -- the destruction of the great white whale. Under his lordly but maniacal command the Pequod's commercial mission is perverted to one of vengeance. To Ahab, the monster that destroyed his body is not a creature, but the symbol of \"some unknown but still reasoning thing.\" Uncowed by natural disasters, ill omens, even death, Ahab urges his ship towards \"the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale.\" Key letters from Melville to Nathaniel Hawthorne are printed at the end of this volume. - Back cover.", "title": "Moby Dick", "covers": [10544254, 8229204, 9341823, 2199528, 1007907, 10089516, 7726876, 10530031, 13195819, 10860984, 11098834, 11138515, 11358399, 11386586, 11420104, 12022194, 12807453, 12813499, 13022202], "subject_places": ["Massachusetts", "Nantucket", "New Bedford", "Cape Horn", "Cape of Good Hope", "Atlantic Ocean", "Pacific Ocean", "Indian Ocean"], "subjects": ["American Sea stories", "Mentally ill", "Whaling", "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "Whales", "great_books_of_the_western_world", "Translations into French", "Literature", "Captain Ahab (Fictitious character)", "American Adventure stories", "Sailors", "Sea stories", "Classic Literature", "Whaling in literature", "Young Adult Fiction", "Open Library Staff Picks", "open_syllabus_project", "Fiction", "Ship captains", "Whaling ships", "Juvenile fiction", "Chasse", "Whales in literature", "Shipwrecks", "Baleines", "Long Now Manual for Civilization", "General", "Children: Grades 4-6", "American fiction (fictional works by one author)", "Ahab, captain (fictitious character), fiction", "Whaling, fiction", "Children's fiction", "Whales, fiction", "Fiction, action & adventure", "Fiction, psychological", "Literature and fiction (general)", "Fiction, sea stories", "Fiction, fantasy, epic", "Poetry (poetic works by one author)", "Melville, herman, 1819-1891", "American literature, history and criticism", "Sea stories, history and criticism", "Literature and fiction, action and adventure", "Illustrations", "Pictorial works", "Drama (dramatic works by one author)", "Picture-writing in literature", "Readers (Primary)", "Readers for new literates", "Adventure and adventurers, fiction", "Ballenas", "Ficci\u00f3n", "Capitanes de barcos", "Enfermos mentales", "Naufragios", "Cuentos de mar", "Novela psicol\u00f3gica", "Romance literature", "Epic literature", "Adventure fiction", "Allegories", "Whalers (Persons)", "Drama", "Revenge", "Prohibition", "Achab (Personnage fictif)", "Romans, nouvelles", "Capitaines de navire", "Personnes vivant avec un trouble de sant\u00e9 mentale", "Action & Adventure", "Walfang", "Moby Dick (Melville, Herman)", "Fiction, historical, general", "Fiction, general", "Moby Dick", "Literatura infantil", "Ahab, captain (fictitious character)", "Ahab, captain (fictitious character)--fiction", "Whales--fiction", "Whaling--fiction", "Ps2384.m6 m45 1992", "813/.3", "Whaling ships--fiction", "Ship captains--fiction", "Mentally ill--fiction", "Ps2384 .m6 2001c", "Shipwrecks--fiction", "Sailors--fiction", "Ps2384 .m6 2003b", "Melville, herman , 1819-1891", "Ps2384 .m6 2002", "Comics & graphic novels, general", "Comic books, strips, etc.", "Fate and fatalism", "Symbolism", "R\u00e9cits de mer"], "subject_people": ["Herman Melville (1819-1891)", "Ishmael", "Ahab", "Starbuck", "Stubb", "Flask", "Queequeg", "Tashtego", "Daggoo", "Fedallah", "Pip"], "key": "/works/OL102749W", "authors": [{"author": {"key": "/authors/OL29497A"}, "type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}}], "excerpts": [{"pages": "1", "excerpt": "Call me Ishmael."}, {"excerpt": "All my means are sane, my motive and my object mad.", "comment": "Chapter XLI: Moby Dick", "author": {"key": "/people/huginn4126"}}, {"excerpt": "Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure.", "comment": "Chapter LVIII: Brit", "author": {"key": "/people/huginn4126"}}], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "identifiers": {"wikidata": ["Q174596"], "bookbrainz": ["ea920175-d12c-40a4-8d40-135f9e2cc0c4"], "musicbrainz": ["fc85fbd0-18dc-4bf0-b3ff-6c77142379f7"]}, "subject_times": ["19th century"], "links": [{"title": "Moby-Dick - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}}], "latest_revision": 119, "revision": 119, "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-10-17T18:36:50.013545"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2025-03-09T23:45:24.942698"}}
